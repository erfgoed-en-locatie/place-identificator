# TODO for the rewrite

- ALL update queries should of course be PER DATASET!!


- setRecordAsUnmappable should also handle liesIn
- save standardized query, with or without liesIn Where!
- save the q= query in the db!

- final rewrite:
    - on loading the dataset, see if it is a valid one

        - also store the liesIn field, AND also store a timestamp, and the query to the API with which it was found, status


- this also makes it possible to do less precise searches ....


- create page for displaying manually mapped crowd source data

- batches?
