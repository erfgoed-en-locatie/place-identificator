# TODO for the rewrite

- should be able to keep earlier (matched/unmatched records
    (dataset_Service clearRecordsForDataset should work with status)

- should do better modelling:
    - place_column and lies_in_column should be in dataset table
    - field_mapping table should be rebamed search_options and only hold the data thats repeatable (maybe more than one row?

+ Started on the new fieldmapping and made it so all of the new fields get stored.
- texts for extra help should be in a simple popover

+ need to refator the PitTypes en PitSources in their own histograph thing when integrating

- need to integrate the new histograpg client library, is now a symlink
    - put on github and packagist
